# Arduino driven car using MATLAB GUI integrated with Simulink
### Modes of operation: 
    1) manual control through gui buttons. 
    2) line follower.

### Notes and Constraints:
    1) You should switch between 2 operations through UI. 
    2) Project should be implemented using "arduino simulink library". 

### Requirements: 
    1) arduino board.
    2) long usb cable. 
    3) rc car.
    4) line follower sensor (digital or analog).
    5) big white board to test ur project.
